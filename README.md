# date-input-polyfill-react
Just include this simple script and IE, Firefox, and OS X Safari will support `<input type="date">`, without any dependencies, not even jQuery!

Support dynamically created inputs, so can be used in single page applications.

Forked from [date-input-polyfill](https://github.com/pangon/date-input-polyfill-react) to make it work with React >= 15.6 (and probably breaking compatibility with anything other than React, never tested that).


The changes to support React have been based on comments and code by:
